        <ul>
            <li><b>What is EV?</b> EV stands for Expected Value, which calculates the average value you expect to get when opening a booster pack.</li>
            <br />
            <li><b>What is Percent Return?</b> The Percent Return compares the EV to the price of the booster pack to tell you on average what percent of your money you will make back. This allows for a fair comparison between sets.</li>
            <br />
            <li><b>How is EV Calculated?</b> First the value for every card from a specific set is found. Then using estimated pull rates EVs are calculated by rarity.
            <br><br>
            Example using Base Set: Each pack contains 11 cards (2 Energy, 5 Common, 3 Uncommon, 1 Rare/Holo), 
            Odds of a Holo Card = 1/3<br><br>
            Total EV = (Average Energy Value * 2) + (Average Common Value * 5) + (Average Uncommon Value * 3) + (Average Rare Value * .67) + (Average Holo Value * .33)</li>
            <br />
            <li><b>How Does The Calculate Sealed Product Value Feature Work?</b> This feature allows you to add up the market prices of the packs inside a given sealed product to see how much value you're really getting.</li>
            <br />
            <li><b>How Does The Calculate EV for Sealed Product Feature Work?</b> This feature allows you to add up the EVs of the packs inside a given sealed product and compare to the product's price so you can guage how much value you should expect upon opening the product.</li>
            <br />
            <li><b>How Does The Calculate EV for Multiple Packs Feature Work?</b> This feature allows you to add up the EVs of different quantities of packs. This feature is also useful for Booster Boxes and Elite Trainer Boxes. For a booster box just enter the set name and 36 for the quantity and now you have the EV for a booster box of that set! </li>
            <br />
            <li><b>Where Does The Data Come From?</b> The prices for packs are sourced from Collectr, and the prices for individual cards are sourced from TCG Player </li>
            <br />
            <li><b>Where Does Pull Rate Data Come From?</b> The pull rates were gathered from community sources that have estimated the rates by set. Official pull rates are unknown. </li>
            <br />
            <li><b>How Often Is The Site Updated?</b> The site is currently manually updated roughly once a week, eventually I would like to update the values daily.  </li>
